> An OpenCode plugin for Beads issue-tracker

An exploration of a OpenCode plugin for [Beads](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/introducing-beads-a-coding-agent-memory-system-637d7d92514a), a git backed task tracker with many LLM integrations, but none for OpenCode... until now!

# Installation

For now, manually copy or link `beads-opencode.ts` into `~/.config/opencode/plugin/beads-opencode.ts`.
