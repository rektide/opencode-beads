# opencode-beads

> An OpenCode plugin for Beads issue-tracker

An exploration of a OpenCode plugin for [Beads](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/introducing-beads-a-coding-agent-memory-system-637d7d92514a), a git backed task tracker with many LLM integrations, but none for OpenCode... until now!

# Installation

For now, manually copy or link `beads-opencode.ts` into `~/.config/opencode/plugin/beads-opencode.ts`.

# Tools

## Navigation

Dumping the entire Beads issue-tracking into OpenCode's Todo is almost certainly not what we want: in many cases we expect that to be far too big. Nav is a set of tools for discovery, and which more, like a directory, it helps us to walk into the tree of tasks, to an area of focus. Other tools will likely be constrained by the nav tool.

# Unofficial

Note that opencode-beads is not a formal project of either OpenCode nor Beads, not built by either team. This is an independent and unaffiliated effort.
